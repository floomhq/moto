# claude-setup

### Production-grade Claude Code configuration, extracted from 500+ real sessions

[![Claude Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude_Code-compatible-blueviolet)](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

A complete Claude Code developer setup: CLAUDE.md templates, 17 safety hooks, 60+ skills, server infrastructure, terminal workflow, WhatsApp/Gmail integration, memory system, and cost tracking. Everything is templated for reuse with no personal data.

---

## Who is this for?

- **Solo developers** using Claude Code daily who want battle-tested guardrails and productivity patterns
- **Teams** standardizing their Claude Code configuration across projects and machines
- **Anyone who's been burned** by Claude running `rm -rf`, pushing secrets, or claiming "should work" without verifying

## What makes this different?

Most Claude Code configs share a single CLAUDE.md. This repo shares the **full stack**: the hooks that enforce the rules, the skills that automate workflows, the server infrastructure that runs it all, and the memory system that makes Claude learn across sessions. Every pattern is extracted from real production use, not hypothetical best practices.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buildingopen/claude-setup.git
cd claude-setup
./install.sh          # Symlinks configs into ~/.claude/
```

That's it. The installer detects existing configs, backs them up, resolves `$HOME` paths in hook commands, and installs 17 hooks + 7 scripts + 60+ skills + memory template. Run `./install.sh --copy` for standalone files instead of symlinks.

**After install:**
1. Edit `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to match your workflow (search for `<!-- Customize -->` comments)
2. Copy `claude/CLAUDE-project.md` into your project roots
3. Optionally copy `.env.example` to `.env` for API keys used by some hooks/scripts

## CLAUDE.md Templates

Two templates encoding months of iteration on making Claude Code reliable:

- **[`claude/CLAUDE.md`](claude/CLAUDE.md)** - Global config (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Drop-in template with engineering principles, self-audit checklist, error recovery, communication standards, and quality gates.
- **[`claude/CLAUDE-project.md`](claude/CLAUDE-project.md)** - Per-project config. Tech stack, key files, testing conventions, deploy config. Copy into any project root.

<details>
<summary><strong>Key patterns in the global CLAUDE.md</strong></summary>

| Pattern | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Read First, Code Later** | 80% reading, 20% writing. No changes without understanding context first. |
| **Self-Audit** | No completion claims without fresh verification evidence. Bans "should work now". |
| **Rationalization Red Flags** | Table of thoughts that signal the agent is about to skip process. |
| **Error Recovery** | Data-driven rules from 10,000+ error analysis (e.g., never retry a blocked hook). |
| **Ripple Check** | After every change, audit the diff for env vars, dependencies, breaking changes. |
| **Quality Gate** | Do not return until genuinely 10/10. List flaws before scoring. |

</details>

## Safety Hooks

17 hooks wired into `settings.json` that prevent Claude from doing damage. They run automatically on every tool call.

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `block-destructive.sh` | Bash | Blocks `rm -rf /`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP TABLE`, `curl\|bash` |
| `protect-sensitive-files.sh` | Write/Edit | Blocks writes to `.pem`, `.key`, `id_rsa`, credentials |
| `protect-config-files.sh` | Write/Edit | Blocks editing linter/formatter configs to bypass checks |
| `scan-secrets-before-push.sh` | Bash | Runs gitleaks before `git push` |
| `enforce-package-manager.sh` | Bash | Detects lock file, blocks wrong package manager |
| `enforce-server-routing.sh` | Bash | Blocks CPU-heavy tasks locally, routes to dev server |
| `suggest-compact.sh` | Edit/Write/Bash | Counts tool calls, suggests `/compact` at threshold |
| `post-compaction-recall.sh` | Any | Detects post-compaction state, suggests session-recall |
| `cost-tracker.sh` | Stop | Tracks token costs per model/session to `costs.jsonl` |
| `gemini-audit.sh` + `.py` | Stop | Opt-in Gemini quality gate: scores output, blocks if < 10 |
| `block-wa-send.sh` | Bash | Blocks unverified WhatsApp sends (optional, not wired by default) |
| `block-terminal-minimize.sh` | Bash | Blocks AppleScript commands that minimize or hide terminal windows |
| `cc-precompact-hook.sh` | PreCompact | Saves git diff, test results, and loop state before context compaction |
| `cc-postcompact-hook.sh` | PostCompact | Restores saved state into context after compaction |
| `enforce-hetzner-heavy-tasks.sh` | Bash | Blocks CPU-heavy tasks locally (Remotion, ffmpeg, Playwright), routes to dev server |
| `rate-limit-auto-resume.sh` | Stop | Detects rate limit messages and schedules automatic resume via macOS `at` |
| `sandbox-heavy-tasks.sh` | PreToolUse | Intercepts memory-hungry commands (whisper, ffmpeg, torch) and routes through sandbox |

All hooks are pure bash (no external deps beyond `jq`). See [`claude/hooks/README.md`](claude/hooks/README.md) for how hooks work, the JSON protocol, and how to wire them in `settings.json`.

**Scripts included:**

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `gemini-fetch.sh` | Fetch blocked URLs via Gemini API (WebFetch fallback) |
| `claude-auto-resume.sh` | Auto-retry on rate limits with exponential backoff |
| `claude-rate-limit-watcher.sh` | Background rate limit monitor daemon |
| `claude-switch.sh` | Switch between multiple Claude accounts |
| `sync-claude-config.sh` | Sync CLAUDE.md across machines via SCP |

## Memory System

An external brain pattern that persists knowledge across Claude Code sessions:

- **`MEMORY.md`** - Concise index (< 200 lines) auto-loaded into every conversation
- **Topic files** - Detailed notes on specific subjects, read on demand
- Claude auto-updates these as it learns preferences, patterns, and corrections

This prevents Claude from repeating mistakes across sessions and lets it build on prior context. See [`claude/memory/README.md`](claude/memory/README.md) for the full pattern.

---

## Server Infrastructure

Templates for running Claude Code on a dedicated dev server (VPS/dedicated). Not needed for local-only setups.

<details>
<summary><strong>What's in server/</strong></summary>

- **Systemd services** - Chrome headless with CDP, SSHFS mounts, CDP keepalive, Docker-host proxy
- **Safety utilities** - `safe-pipeline` (flock + timeout + cgroup memory cap), `safe-run`, stale process cleanup
- **Browser automation** - Chrome CDP setup guide, bridge keeper for session persistence
- **Multi-account management** - GitHub, Render, Supabase account switching patterns
- **Terminal workflow** - tmux config, bashrc (999K history, aliases), background task queue system

</details>

---

## WhatsApp & Gmail Integration

**WhatsApp** (via [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) gateway):
- Docker-based WhatsApp Web bridge
- Verified send script with SQLite contact lookup (prevents wrong-number sends)
- Direct SQLite DB reading for message history

**Gmail** (via IMAP):
- Multi-account email checking
- Preserves read/unread status (`BODY.PEEK[]` instead of `RFC822`)
- Standalone Python script, stdlib only, no pip dependencies

## Requirements

| Requirement | Required? | Used by |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Yes | Everything |
| `jq` | Yes | All hooks (JSON parsing) |
| `python3` | Optional | Gemini audit hook, email checker |
| `gitleaks` | Optional | Secret scanning hook |
| Gemini API key | Optional | `gemini-fetch.sh`, `gemini-audit` |

---

## Configuration

After running `install.sh`:

1. **Edit CLAUDE.md** - Search for `<!-- Customize -->` comments and replace placeholders with your setup (server names, tool routing rules, project paths)
2. **Add project configs** - Copy `claude/CLAUDE-project.md` to each project root and fill in the tech stack section
3. **API keys** (optional) - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for hooks/scripts that need external APIs

The `settings.json` file has `$HOME` paths pre-resolved by the installer. If you update the repo's `settings.json`, re-run `./install.sh` to pick up changes.
