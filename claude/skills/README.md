# Claude Skills

Skills are slash commands that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations. Think of them as "onboarding guides" that transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent equipped with procedural knowledge for specific domains.

## What Skills Are

Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file (required) and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: metadata + instructions
├── scripts/              # Optional: executable scripts
├── references/           # Optional: reference docs loaded as needed
└── assets/               # Optional: templates, fonts, files used in output
```

The `SKILL.md` file has two parts:
- **YAML frontmatter**: `name` and `description` fields. The description is what Claude reads to determine when to trigger the skill.
- **Markdown body**: Instructions loaded after the skill is triggered.

Claude reads ALL skill descriptions at startup to know what's available. The body is only loaded when the skill is triggered - this keeps the context window lean.

## How to Install

If you use the repo's `install.sh` script, skills are installed automatically. Manual copying is only needed if you are not using the installer.

Copy the skill directory into `~/.claude/commands/`:

```bash
# Install a single skill
cp -r skills/debug/ ~/.claude/commands/debug/

# Install all skills
cp -r skills/*/ ~/.claude/commands/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/commands/
```

After installation, the skill is available as `/<skill-name>` in Claude Code.

## How Skills Trigger

Skills trigger when Claude detects a match between the user's request and a skill's `description`. The description should include:
- What the skill does
- Specific trigger phrases
- When to use it

Claude also proactively invokes skills when it detects a matching task, even without an explicit slash command.

## How to Create Your Own

Use the `skill-creator` skill for guided creation, or follow this template:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: >
  What this skill does and when to use it. Include specific trigger phrases
  like "when user says X" or "use when user asks to Y". This description
  is what Claude reads to decide whether to invoke the skill.

# My Skill Title

## Overview

[What this skill provides that Claude doesn't already know]

## Step 1: [First step]

[Instructions...]

## Step 2: [Second step]

[Instructions...]
```

Key principles:
- Only include information Claude doesn't already have
- Prefer examples over explanations
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; move details to reference files
- The description is the trigger mechanism - make it comprehensive

See `skill-creator/SKILL.md` for the full guide.

## Customization

Many skills reference environment variables or project-specific paths that you'll need to configure:

- `email-check`: Set up IMAP credentials for your email accounts
- `deploy`: Update with your project's specific deployment commands
- `compass`: Point to your own strategy/status file
- `new-project`: Update the default GitHub organization

Skills are designed to be starting points. Edit them to match your workflow.
